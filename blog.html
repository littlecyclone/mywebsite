      <p>We’re experimenting with Vagrant virtual machines for development. <br>To use your host machine browser against a virtual machine web server, Vagrant must forward some host machine port to the server’s port. <br>So on your host machine, you may use<br><br>http://localhost:8001 for app1 and <br>http://localhost:8002 for app2.
